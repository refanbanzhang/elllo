They don't get paid enough and then you have people who are just playing a game and they get paid so much money and I think it's a little unfair. </p><p><strong>Kate, New Zealand</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Kate-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think athletes, they don't make too much money, because they're playing exactly what, their favorite sports and they enjoy what they do. However, I heard about the NHL in Canada, the hockey, and their asking for more money, and more money, and I think it's, they should just take the money that they have because they get a lot of money already. They shouldn't keep asking for more money.</p><p><strong>Jim, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jim-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think athletes make far too much money, especially footballers. This is soccer players for those people who speak American English. I think that people like nurses, doctors, teachers, they should be getting more money, not people who play sport.</p><p><strong>Rina, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Rina-CAN.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think professional players do deserve the money they get. They're <span class=\"audionotes\">protraying</span> their image publicly and risking their bodies to entertain us and there's a lot of money that goes into it, why shouldn't they <span class=\"audionotes\">reap the benefits</span>. Why should the owners, or the people that are making profits in other areas, when they're doing all the work, reap all the benefits.</p><p><strong>Al, England</strong><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Al-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong><br> Yes, I certainly think, especially professional footballers earn much too much money. One guy called Rio Ferdinand just singed a contract for 100,000 pounds, per week and that's more money than I'll ever earn in my entire life, so I don't think that's fair.</p><p><strong>Todd, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-US-Todd.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Ah, no, I don't think they make too much money. I think athletes deserve all the money they get. I mean they make a lot of money, and it seems crazy that they make so much money, but <span class=\"audionotes\">the bottom line</span> is so many people watch their games buy their jerseys. Buy tickets to follow them, listen to them on radio, so they bring in a lot of <span class=\"audionotes\">revenue</span>, and they are the reason that people watch them so they should get all the money that they earn. Maybe they should give a little more to charity, or give some of the money back to the communities, but yeah, they deserve the money they get.</p>",

Although cats are very cute, but dogs also, I like to be active. I like to run around the lawn and take them for walks, and actually, the dogs are more like a little kid, and I actually have a dog. I own a dog in New Zealand and every day I take him for a walk and feed him just like my own little child.</p><p><strong>Tres, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Tres-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Let's see, cats or dogs. I think I would prefer a dog over a cat and the reason being, cats make me sneeze, and they make my eyes itch, whereas dogs I'm not too <span class=\"audionotes\">allergic</span> too. On the other hand, dogs have personality. Cats seem to be a bit smarter <span class=\"audionotes\">at times</span>, more like humans but I think a dog is a lot more fun to be around, plus, you know, if you're ever in a time of need, a dog may save your life, where a cat will just watch you die.</p><p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Cats or dogs, that's a good question. Well, I think I would have to say cats because although I like both, cats are more independent and they can find their own food and they don't need to be taken for walks, and generally they're less needy, so I think I would say cats.</p><p><strong>Jim, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jim-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I prefer dogs to cats because I think they're loyal and always pleased to see you. I think cats are a little bit selfish, but I have to say I've never had neither. I've only had a tortoise.</p><p><strong>Eucharia, Ireland</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Eucharia-IRE.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think cats are better pet than dogs because cats don't need to be <span class=\"audionotes\">minded</span>. You don't have to worry about feeding a cat, walking a cat. A cat is <span class=\"audionotes\">independent</span> and will walk itself, so um, also they don't require as much training as dogs so they're a much nicer pet I think.</p><p><strong>Alan, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Alan-CA.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I prefer cats. Cats are clean, quite, <span class=\"audionotes\">low maintenance</span> animals. You feed them. You let them out once in awhile. You give them attention, and they're happy. I used to have a cat and I was quite happy with it.</p>",

I think I would rather watch a movie at the cinema because in the cinema they have a really good stereo so you can really enjoy the movie. Of course, watching a movie on DVD is good because you can relax at home but I would choose to spend the money and go to the cinema and have a really good time.</p><p><strong>Martin, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Martin-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>My favorite way to watch a movie is at the cinema. I like the experience of being in a cinema, sitting in those nice <span class=\"audionotes\">comfy chairs</span>, but especially the big screen. I think that's the most important thing as well as the sound in a cinema is a lot nicer than the one in my home, but seeing Laurence on Arabia or any other epic on a big screen is quite the experience and I'm willing to go take the time and see it at the cinema rather than at home.</p><p><strong>Barbara, Australia</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Barbaraa-AU.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Would I rather watch a movie at the cinema or at home on DVD? Well, I would definitely rather go to the cinema. There's <span class=\"audionotes\">a special magic</span> at the cinema. You know, you're sitting there with your friends and you know, talking before the movie starts and then the lights go down and you've got your popcorn and your soft drinks and everything. That reminds me of, you know, having fun in childhood. If you're at home, you can, with a DVD, you can <span class=\"audionotes\">fast forward</span> or whatever you like. Maybe it's more convenient, but it's just not so much fun.</p><p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>DVD or the cinema? That's a good question. I mean I really like watching DVDs with my friends. I really like going to someone's house and it's a cheap way of watching a movie but I also really like going the cinema and I really like the atmosphere there. I prefer the atmosphere there to watching a DVD, and the other thing about the cinema is that I concentrate when I'm at the cinema. If I watch a DVD at home. I stop and go and I do some jobs. I can't focus, so I would say that I like the cinema.</p><p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"71\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Ah, <span class=\"audionotes\">no question</span>, it's much better to watch a movie in the cinema, movie theater. I mean the screen is ten times as big, the sound system is huge and it's <span class=\"audionotes\">an outing</span>. You know, watching a DVD at home is kind of like watching TV. No big deal.</p><p><strong>Jeannie, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeanie-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>OK, so I prefer to watch movies in a cinema. I love the big screen and the surround sound is great and and I like to sit around a lot of people and get their reactions as well as my own. Unfortunately a lot of times, it's just cheaper to see it on a DVD for me because people often give me DVDs as gifts. </p>",

I have time to do things that I could never do in the city, like play guitar or even read the news, and I'm enjoying a peaceful lifestyle a lot more than the busy city life.</p><p><strong>Martin, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Martin-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>If I wanted to live in the city or country, I'd have to say <span class=\"audionotes\">nowadays</span>, in the city. I grew up in the country in a very small farm and it was kind of boring. I enjoyed the clean air and the <span class=\"audionotes\">wildlife</span> around but it was boring. The city is much more exciting and a lot more to do and see and experience, so <span class=\"audionotes\">by and large</span>, the city for me is the way to go.</p><p><strong>Mitchell, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mitchell-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I would rather live in the countryside because I'm from the islands and and everythings more peaceful, relax, and time seems to go by slowly.

That's a tough one because I think the death penalty is a good <span class=\"audionotes\">deterrent</span>. It would definitely stop me from doing certain crimes if I knew that I was going to be killed if I did them, but the problem with it is, is that you can never be sure if the person actually did it, so if we convict someone and then kill him and later find out that the person actually didn't do the crime, then I think that's a tragedy.</p><p><strong>Steve, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/UK-Steve.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I'm against the death penalty, for, well, the main reason I'm against it, is that there's always <span class=\"audionotes\">an element of doubt</span>. You never know if someone really did murder someone, or. well, murder is usually the main reason for the death penalty, so there's always an element of doubt.

Most of the time, I think that I'm against the death penalty, but then, you know, you read stories in the newspaper, especially about children being killed, particularly cruel ways of ending people's lives, and then sometimes, I get so angry that I think, yeah, just kill that person because they deserve it, but really, when I calm down, I don't believe in the death penalty.</p>",

I like clothes that fit me rather than, and <span class=\"audionotes\">suit me</span>, rather than brand labels.

Not really. I usually wear whatever is comfortable. I don't usually care about <span class=\"audionotes\">name brands</span> or anything like that. I just go with what looks best on me and, yeah, it's got to be cool.</p><p><strong>Kate, New Zealand</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Kate-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Fashion is not so important to me, but I do sometimes like to put an effort into how I look and into my appearance. I think that fashion expresses who you are and it can differentiate you from others but however on the other hand, people can judge you on fashion and your appearance and this is not a good thing. You should look further than the appearance.</p><p><strong>Rina, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Rina-CAN.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Fashion is not important to me. I try not to be <span class=\"audionotes\"><a href=\"../../ANA/AN/M001A/MX009-5-slaveto.mp3\">a slave to</a></span> corporate logos and I just know what I like and I dress the way I like and if I see something that is in fashion and I like I'll wear it and if I see something that isn't in fashion, or is in fashion and I don't like it, I won't wear it.</p><p><strong>Marion, Ireland</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Marion-IRE.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>No, I don't think fashion is very important. I think it's more important to wear clothes that you're comfortble in and clothes that <span class=\"audionotes\">express</span> your personality in some way, so perhaps sometimes I'll see something that's the latest fashion and I might like it but usually, if it's something a bit crazy, I don't like it, but sometimes, then after awhile, after I see a lot of people wearing it, it <span class=\"audionotes\">grows on me</span>.</p>",

It was a lot of fun seeing kids <span class=\"audionotes\">open their eyes</span> to mathematics and science and wanted to know more and asking questions that I couldn't answer.

You can have Thai food, Indian food, Chinese food, French food, Italian food, Portuguese food, all kinds of food, and I really, really enjoy that part of my city.</p><p><strong>Barbara / Australia</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Barbaraa-AU.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>One good thing about my hometown?

Definitely when I was in high school, I used to wear clothes that were a bit more <span class=\"audionotes\">revealing</span> and I used to <span class=\"audionotes\">wear heels</span> and I don't do that anymore, and I am beginning to get a bit of wrinkles under my eyes, so I do think that I've changed.</p>",

That would be my perfect day off.</p>",

Actually I like it, but I'm controlling myself right now.</p><p><strong>Mitchell, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mitchell-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>The junk food I tend to eat is gummy bears because I like, like the gummy kind of candy, gummy bears, sour patch kids, but I don't think I eat too much junk food because I don't eat too much cake, chocolate, cookies, and the dairy product section, so but if I had to pick a junk food that I eat the most, it's sweets like gummy bears, starbursts, skittles.</p><p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>How much junk food? Well, actually I try really hard not to eat junk food. I try to go for a long time without eating crips and chocolate and cakes, but often I tend to ignore that and eat them anyway. I think it goes in phases. For a long time I'll not have any and then for a week or two weeks I will eat cake, cake, cake, chocolate, <span class=\"audionotes\">crisps</span>, all of the time, so maybe, certainly at those time I eat too much. The rest of the time, no, I think it's OK.</p><p><strong>Lucinda, New Zealand</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Lucinda-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I don't eat junk food, sweet junk food, so I'm actually lying, I don't eat sweet junk food.

I used to eat more of it when I was younger, but I've kind of <span class=\"audionotes\">trimmed it down</span> a little bit, and I got older, how ever, I still enjoy a good bag of potato chips while I watch TV, or a chocolate bar occasionally, after lunch or dinner, so I would say. I enjoy junk food but I try now to eat too much of it.</p><p><strong>Mark, America</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mark-US.jpg\" width=\"49\"></strong>Actually, I don't eat a lot of junk food, but I try to keep pretty healthy with what I eat, but if I <span class=\"audionotes\">slip</span> and I do eat any food that's not healthy it's usually fast food. Like I almost never eat at McDonald's, but if I'm really hungry, or I'm really broke and don't have a lot of money, or I just want something fast, I might sneak into a McDonalds, once every two weeks or something like that.</p>",

Many reasons, the number one being it looks like an absolutely gorgeous country, especially having seen Lord of the Rings and that is one of my favorite movies. Another reason is, I've never been south of the equator and I'd really like to see if the water <span class=\"audionotes\">flushes</span> in reverse, but on the, <span class=\"audionotes\">by and large</span> New Zealand looks like the most amazing country and I've met a lot of nice people from there.</p><p><strong>Akane, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Akane-CAN.jpg\" width=\"49\"></strong>One country that I would like to visit is France.

I'm from America and Canada is our neighbor to the north and I've never been there and I live overseas. I've been to many countries, probably 25 at least, Japan, France, Italy, Thailand, many, many places, but I've never been to Canada and I have so many Canadian friends that I would really like to go to Canada and see their country for the first time.</p><p><strong>Naomi, Australia</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Naomi-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>One country that I would really like to visit is Vietnam. I've never been anywhere in that area of Asia actually but I've seen a lot of <span class=\"audionotes\">footage</span> of Vietnam on television and it looks really beautiful. I think you can take relaxing boat cruises through the lagoons and small islands and also I heard that the food there is really tasty so I would like to visit there one day.</p><p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>One country I'd really like to visit is actually Malawi. Now I would like to go to Malawi because my mom used to work there. She lived there for two years, and I've seen some of her photos and it looks amazing, so I'd like to go there. I'd like to go there with my mum so that I can learn more about the places that she went to and see some of the things that she saw. That's where I'd like to go.</p><p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"71\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Yeah, one country where I'd like to visit again would be Cuba. Cuba is great.

I think I would like to spend more time outside.</p><p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"71\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I wish I had more time to just hang out with friends, you know, not only me but also friends don't have a lot of free time but since it's summer now it would be great that if three days a week I could just hang out and have a barbeque with my friends</p>",

It tends to rain for most of the year so I'm quite used to rain, but it's a soft rain, so I quite like the soft rain. I don't like really, really hard rain that stops you from doing things. On a rainy day, I usually stay inside and if I'm in Ireland, I'll <span class=\"audionotes\">curl up</span> by the fire and read a really good book.</p><p><strong>Kate, New Zealand</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Kate-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>On a rainy day, I just love to <span class=\"audionotes\">sleep in</span>, until about 11 or 12 o'clock, because I can feel, I feel more calmer and I feel more relaxed, and then I might watch some TV, watch a movie with my friends at home, cook some popcorn, and generally for the whole day, we just relax at home.</p><p><strong>Jeyong, Korea</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeyong-KOR.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I don't like rain and that's because rainy days make me very sad and depressed so most of the rainy days I stay at home, not, I try not to go outside and at home I would just get a cup of coffee, turn on the air-conditioner, turn on the internet and chat with friends whose online.</p><p><strong>Jeannie, America</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeanie-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Ah,the rain!

It can be quite romantic when you're with someone you love. That's a good thing.

Well, most of my life my family has always been a bit envious of my ability to save. Even when I didn't have a job, I would always have money just backed up somewhere and people would often have to try and get money from me on loan. It's a little difficult now that I have to actually pay rent and things like that but, I'm still pretty good at it.</p><p><strong>Mark / United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mark-US.jpg\" width=\"49\"></strong>I am terrible at saving money, absolutely terrible.

I go out and I'll spend a hundred dollars in one night, it just, because I got the money in my pocket and then usually before payday, I don't have any money and I'm borrowing money from my friends so it's actually my worst habit, is saving money.</p><p><strong>Ruth / England</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Good at saving money!

I go shopping usually to just normal middle of the road type places, but I really, really like shoe shopping.</p><p><strong>Alan, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Alan-CA.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>What do I think about shopping?

If I need them, I will go out and buy them, but I don't really like to browse and look around too much, window shop, anything like that. I do however do enjoy food shopping. I enjoy that. Everyone has to food shop at least once a week, so I enjoy shopping for food more than I do shopping for other things. </p>",

    "html": "<p><strong>Eucharia, Ireland</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Eucharia-IRE.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Is TV a good or bad influence? Well, most people would say it's a bad influence but my university lecturer when I was in university, quite some time ago had a very interesting take, he said that media doesn't influence society, that these <span class=\"audionotes\">behaviors</span> are learned. He used the example of Japan at that time having the lowest crime rate in the world and the most violent media in the world, including video games, manga, which are the comics, and in general, Japanese TV, so yeah, there are two ways to think about it. Most people would immediately say it's <span class=\"audionotes\">a bad influence</span> but maybe it's not.</p><p><strong>Mark, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mark-US.jpg\" width=\"49\"></strong>I don't think TV's a bad thing but I never ever watch it because it is <span class=\"audionotes\">extremely addictive</span>, or I'm extremely, I can get very addicted to it. If I turn on the TV, I will watch it for two hours, but I'll just flip through the channels without actually stopping on any one thing, so I never turn on the TV.</p><p><strong>Kate, New Zealand</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Kate-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think TV can be good and bad. First of all, it can be good like for example the learning channels, discovery channels, animal planet, things, such channels like those. However, of course there's bad points to TV such as violence and fighting which should not be watched by small children. In fact, in my country, they put the more violent scenes and more violent channels after 8 p.m., once the children have gone to bed.</p><p><strong>Jeannie, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeanie-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>TV is both good and bad. It's not really the TV's fault what people are putting on it. Some of the children's programs I say are really good for kids. I used to sit my neice in front of a child's program and she picked up her ABC's pretty quickly and she sung along with the songs and everything, so I think that was pretty good but of course you have programs that are a bit too violent maybe but they're learning opportunities and you have your nonsense</p><p><strong>Rina, Canada</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Rina-CAN.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Is TV a good thing or a bad thing? Well, for me I think it's wonderful because it's a form of something that entertains me without asking anything in return. For young children, I think it is a cause of a lot of <span class=\"audionotes\">desensitization</span> but I don't think it is <span class=\"audionotes\">the sole cause</span> of what's going on in the world in general and should be blamed for what is like the shootings and everything, and that's negative happening right now.</p><p><strong>Todd, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Todd.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think television is a very good thing. Not so much for what people can see but what for television can do. TV requires a lot of skilled workers and a lot of people to put on a production so television just creates a lot of jobs and in every country, you need people from your own country to run the television stations to be the cameramen, to do the editing. You need local people to be the actors, technicians, things like that so TV is not and industry where you can export jobs and it's an industry where basically a lot of jobs are provided for local people, so yeah, I think television's a good thing.</p>",

After that I take a shower <span class=\"audionotes\">like everybody else</span>, shave, and then have to have my coffee and my yogurt, and then maybe a quick 5, 10 minute workout and <span class=\"audionotes\">off to work I go.</span></p><p><strong>Naomi, Australia </strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Naomi-NZ.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Usually in the morning, I'll wake up at about 7:30 and I'll put the kettle on and make myself a cup of coffee. Often also, I'll toast myself some bread with butter and Veggiemite. After this, after breakfast, I will brush my teeth and get ready for classes.</p><p><strong>Jeyong, South Korea </strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeyong-KOR.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>A typical morning for me would be getting up at 7 o'clock in the morning. Open up the window and go to the bathroom, take a shower, get my hair dried, put my clothes on and have a breakfast. That would be a typical morning for me.</p><p><strong>Mark, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mark-US.jpg\" width=\"49\"></strong>A typcial morning for me? I guess like anyone else, I wake up. I usually don't eat breakfast right away, but I get a shower and get dressed for work and usually grab a quick breakfast <span class=\"audionotes\">on my way out the door</span>. That's typical morning on the week. On the weekend, I used to sleep in but actually these day, I like to get up earlier on the weekend, than during the week because I feel that's my one free day, so I get up pretty early and usually go do something on that Saturday or Sunday.</p><p><strong>Jeanie, United States</strong><br><strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeanie-US.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>OK, a typical morning for me is pretty hectic. It usually involves <span class=\"audionotes\">squeezing</span> too many things in too little time. Ah, usually I wake up and I go running. After which, I have to take a shower and prepare myself for classes I'll be teaching, not just for one day, but mostly for the whole week, reviewing things that have gone wrong, and things that can maybe be improved.</p>",

That means that the winters aren't too cold. They're a bit cold but now very cold and the summers don't get that hot. They stay quite cool in the summer. Where I'm from in Toronto, many people don't like the weather because the winters are very, very long and harsh, and the summers are very, very hot and humid.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>I'm from Canada so the best weather in Canada, I would say is the West Coast.

Ah, the worst weather in my country is also the West Coast for the rest of the year.

I think it rains all the time and I really get <span class=\"audionotes1\">depressed</span> in the rain, and the best weather is my hometown, Colorado, because it doesn't rain much.

It's terrible if I'm <span class=\"audionotes\">stuck</span> on the train or waiting for something and I don't have something to read so I tend to buy a lot of books, novels, a few magazines, reader's digest and also I waste a lot of money on shampoo because I have long hair and I have to wash my face every day.

I often spend too much money on jewelry because shiny things really <span class=\"audionotes\">attract</span> me. If I'm shopping somewhere and there's something flashy shining at me I usually stop and look and often times the salesperson can get me to buy. Another thing, might be books but I don't know so much if that is a waste or not.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Mark, Unites States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mark-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"49\" height=\"70\"></strong>Ah, I waste money on, I guess mostly on going out, like whether it's going to restaurants or, I don't really go to clubs or anything, but, yeah, I just spend money temporary things.

I'm always buying DVDs and I'll be in some electronics, like store, and I'll see a new DVD and I'll buy it rather than just go to the video store and rent it. I don't know why but I like to buy the DVD when it has the special stuff on the back, but still, it's pretty expensive when you think about it, so, yeah, I waste way too much money on DVDs.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Naomi, Australia</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Naomi-NZ.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Something I waste money on often is clothes shopping. I guess because I'm a girl to start with shopping is always a fun <span class=\"audionotes\">pastime</span> and I find it relaxing, actually I call it shopping therapy to go and buy some new clothes often buy myself, I go shopping but shopping is something I spend or waste money on.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Jeyong, Korea</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeyong-KOR.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I usually don't spend that much money on anything but then if there's something I waste money it would be food.

I always <span class=\"audionotes\">crave</span> Irish soda bread. My grandmother used to make it when I was a child in a really <span class=\"audionotes\">old-fashioned</span> fire oven and there was nothing like it. It's kind of, some people describe it as cake without bread, without sugar, but it's quite heavy and it's really healthy and good for the body.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Jeannie, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeanie-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>A food I always crave is probably pizza.

I am crazy about hot dogs. I don't know why, maybe because I love baseball, but a hot dog and a nice hot dog bun with good mustard is just the best food in the world, and I know hot dogs are terrible. They're not the best thing to eat. They're not good for your body, but there's just something about the taste of a nice hot dog and a coke.

Well, I've always like the idea of having a big family so I think that having a big family is a really good thing. I come from a small family.

Which is better? I grew up in a big family and it was really good: four brothers and one sister and my parents and a dog, so there were lots of people around and I think a big family is good. You're never lonely and there's always someone to <span class=\"audionotes\">hang around with</span> or play with or do something with and lots of things to share and you learn some good <span class=\"audionotes\">values</span> about sharing and beint patient and, yeah, I think big families are better than small families.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Jeyong, Korea</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeyong-KOR.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I think it's better to have a big family because for instance, I have a family of six members: my dad, my mom, older sister, younger sister and a younger brother and me, so when we are all together, the six of us, it's very fun talking and eating food. It's interesting how everybody is very different from each other.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Big or small? Well, I'm from a small family, which I think is really good because we're really <span class=\"audionotes\">close knit</span> and we get to spend more time together because we are small, but having said that, probably because I am from a small family, I would like to be from a big family, because in a big family, you always have company. You have a wider variety of people to spend time with, and I associate big families with fun and laughter, so I think I would prefer a big family even though I like my small family.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>Yeah, I think to be part of a small family is better. I'm an only child, so I've only known life in a small family. Definitely if you're part of a small family, or you're a child in a small family, you're the <span class=\"audionotes\">number one banana</span>. You're parents do everything for you. They take care of only you, or if you have one other sibling, you know, if you live in a family of eight, you know, love and things like that have to shared more so, that's that.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Todd, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Todd.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I think for the child it's better to have a big family because then you have more brothers and sisters to do stuff with and you'll have special memories and when you get older you'll be <span class=\"audionotes\">able to look back</span> and think of all the good times you had with your brothers and sisters, but I think for parents, these days it's better to just have a very small family, maybe just one or two children because things are so expensive and it's just really hard to raise a big family these days.</p>\n                              <p>&nbsp;</p>\n                            ",

It's really tough, but I had great friends so we did a lot of joint studies and great fun, ideas, yep.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Rina, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Rina-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I loved high school. I <span class=\"audionotes\">absolutely</span> loved it. I can't even describe. I grew up in a town of a 1,000 people and so my whole graduating class was 35 people and we were all very, very close and still my best friends are two people from my high school so, yeah, loved it.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Todd, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Todd.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I have to admit, I loved high school. I thought high school was the best. It's a really good time, you know, you know you play sports, you're in clubs, you're hanging out with your friends, but what I remember most about high school though, is that <span class=\"audionotes\">I thought it would never end</span>. I mean at that point, you've only been in school your entire life and I remember thinking, \" You know what, I'm always going to be a student. They're never going to let me out of school.\" But eventually they did.</p>\n                            ",

Oh, that's an easy one. I definitely would like to be a musician. I'd hate to be a politician, and I'd hate to be a movie star, and there's not much difference between a politician and a movie star because they're both great actors. Politicians just act. They're not too honest and a pro athlete would be fun but you can only do it when you're young. A musician, you can do it until you're <span class=\"audionotes\">old and gray</span> and you can keep wailing on your guitar, your saxaphone, and I'd like to be a musician.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Jeyong, Korea</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Jeyong-KOR.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I'd like to be a movie star and that's because I like acting and I think it's be interesting if I can act for a scene like crying, I can <span class=\"audionotes\">drop tears</span> very easily and laugh, and give a big smile to the audience and if there's like an eating scene, I think I can eat very well.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Martin, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Martin-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What would I rather be, a movie star, a politician, a pro athlete, or a musician? I'd have to say, I'd wanna be a movie star cause I love movies and I'd like to be in them. I can make direction decisions and hopefully make better movies than are out there right now. I wouldn't really want to be a politician because I don't really want to have my life <span class=\"audionotes\">raked over the coals</span>, but a movie star will be OK.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I think I'd most want to be a movie star. I'd like to be glamorous and able to dress up on the red carpet. I'd least like to be a politician because I think a lot of people complain about them all the time and they're never viewed very well.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>So, I think I'd want to be a pro athlete. I love the outdoors. I love sports. I wouldn't mind being <span class=\"audionotes\">idolized</span> like many pro athletes are, and basically you get to play a game for a living and you make a lot of money. Something that I wouldn't want to do would be to be a politician. I don't like politics and I heard somewhere that someone says that once you become a politician you just <span class=\"audionotes\">inherentl</span>y lie, and I wouldn't want to do that every day.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Todd, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Todd.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Yeah, I think I'd want to be a politician because if you're a politician you can make changes, you can influence people's lives. I know a lot of politicians are dishonest but I think you have the chance to do good and make changes. If you're a movie star or a singer, you're gonna get old and when you get old, you won't be popular and an athlete you have a very short career. You can't have a very long career either, so I think the best bet is to be a politician and influence people and be productive your entire life.</p>\n                              <p></p>\n                              <p>&nbsp;</p>\n                            ",

I have to say, and older doctor, cause I don't really want to go to the doctor but if I have to I'd like to go to somewhere, where they have a sense of they know what they are doing, and I'm sure the young doctor knows what he's doing but I have a lot more faith and trust in an older doctor who's been around and can do things.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Mitchell, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mitchell-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>It doesn't matter if it's young or old, but I prefer an old male doctor, because he has experience, I would think, but if it was a female, I would prefer a young female doctor because I'll be more likely to go the doctor if I'm sick, or if I catch a cold or.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, Ireland</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I think I prefer a young doctor. They're <span class=\"audionotes\">easier to deal with</span> and they listen more to what you have to say. I also find them a lot more relaxing. BUt my own doctor, we've been with the same doctor for several years and he's kind of older but because we've always gone to him he's really easy to talk to.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Shuan, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Shuan-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I prefer an old doctor because I believe that they have more experience, except there are some issues that I have. An old doctor might not be as <span class=\"audionotes\">well-versed</span> in new medicines that have some out but a new doctor might, or a young doctor might, but obviously I would think that the new doctor would have more experience <span class=\"audionotes\">over all</span>.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>OK, would I prefer a young doctor or an old doctor. I think I would prefer the young doctor. The young doctor might be more up on new technology, new science and new methods and things like that. Also, they're probably more <span class=\"audionotes\">gung-ho</span>, care more about the patients because they're new and they want to impress. An old doctor, maybe he or see is already thinking about retirement, although, that's not always the case.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Tom, United Kindom</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Tom-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Yeah, there are a lot of reasons I would prefer to be seen by a younger doctor. They went to medical school more recently, so they're more up-to-date. They haven't forgotten anything yet. They'd be closer to my age, which makes it easier to talk to them and to discuss what's going on. What kind of problems there are. Plus, if they're younger, they're working harder.</p>\n                              <p></p>\n                              <p>&nbsp;</p>\n                            ",

Surfing the net for various news sites and the TV and newspaper become <span class=\"audionotes\">secondary sources</span> for news.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Asako, Japan</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Asako-JPN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>How do I get my news? My news source would be usually the internet. Other than that we don't have a TV so I don't watch TV so sometimes when I drive actually I do listen to news.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Greg, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Greg.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>OK, so sometimes I watch CNN. Most of my news comes from different Internet news sources such as BBC or, I can't remember the names right now but different sites and I also read newspapers such as the Daily Yomiuri and the Japan times.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Lucinda, New Zealand</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Lucinda-NZ.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>The only time in my life I've ever read newspapers is if a professor or teacher asks us to read and bring an article to school. I don't think I've ever <span class=\"audionotes\">voluntarily</span> read a newspaper. That's quite embarassing but I prefer to watch TV, or listen to the radio to find out about news or things like that.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Martin, The Unites States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Martin-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I usually get my news in the morning off the Internet. I don't really watch TV so I don't watch a lot of that, but the other important way I get news is from the newspaper and my favorite magazine, The Economist, but I'd say the most important way is off the internet, reading a whole bunch of different newspapers on the Internet at once is a really great way to understand and see <span class=\"audionotes\">what's going on</span> in the world.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Todd, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Todd.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Well, because I live overseas I get almost all of my news from the Internet, but I do buy magazines, like Time magazine and Newsweek and read them a little bit and of course I buy, I get the paper sometimes, but actually, when I'm home in America I really like to watch network news. I like the old network news, you know the big TV station, and they have the 6 o'clock news. I don't know. I just like it.</p>\n                              <p></p>\n                            </div><p></p><p align=\"left\"></p></div>",

I love doing sports. I get to check what athletes are doing well. Who's doing bad. What teams are doing good. What championships are being won. And since I'm from Hawaii, the Hawaii newspaper, I tends to read the Island Style section, where it <span class=\"audionotes\">keeps you updated</span> on local news. New foods and products. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Anita, Taiwan</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Anita-TAIWAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What part of the newspaper do I read first? When I read the newspaper, the first thing I will read, about the cover sheet, and <span class=\"audionotes\">check up on</span> what's the most important thing of the newspaper for the day, and after than I will check out the TV programs and some entertainment news, and of course I will check out the weather and the currency of each country as well.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Asako, Japan</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Asako-JPN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Let's see, I don't read the newspaper, therefore I can't answer this questions, however when I look at the Internet, the news site, I usually start with of course, the cover site, cover page, cover site and just look really fast and find out what's going on in the world.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Greg, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/US-Greg.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I start with the front page and then I start <span class=\"audionotes\">shifting throught</span> he pages and towards the international news but if I by chance see the comics first I go to the comics. The comics always relax me.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Which part do I read first? Well, let me start by telling you the part that I read last. I leave the sport until last because the sport for me is not really that interesting. It's a little bit <span class=\"audionotes\">pointless</span>, so usually I begin with the front page, and I read the newspaper in order then when it gets to the sports page, I stop and I finished.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>When I read the newspaper, I usually read the sports section first. Sports is nice light reading, and you don't have to think too much and it's fun and then after sports finished, I get into the heavy stuff like world news and <span class=\"audionotes\">all that kind of Jazz</span>.</p>\n                            </div>",

When I've got a cold, I will stay at home and my grandmother always gives me a special herb tea for colds, and my grandmother always gives me a hand massage. But now I live by myself so when I got a cold I will just make myself herb tea and try the way my grandmother always did on me.

Usually, if I have holidays from work I will go to bed for the weekend, maybe drink lots of hot drink and sometimes eat oranges and <span class=\"audionotes\">citrus</span> fruit for vitimin C, but I think the only think you can do with a cold is to <span class=\"audionotes\">wait it out</span>.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Tres, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Tres-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>Whenever I have a cold, I think it is good to get a lot of rest.

You know, actually if I have a cold, I do absolutely nothing. I don't really understand these cold remedies and my theory is that, if you have a cold and you take all of these cold remedies and antibiotics, they don't help because your body is immune to them, so you may as well just not take anything let your body heal itself. That's what I tend to do. Although on occasion, when my cold has been really bad, I have taken somthing.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>What do I do for a cold?

My country is Canada, so I'd have to say my hometown, Vancouver, although <span class=\"audionotes\">previously</span> I said that it's overrated to some of my friends, it's still a good size city, not too big, not too small. It's quite beautiful. It's got mountains. It has trees and it's got city life. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>The best city in my country? Well, actually, I really like London and I really like that fact that it's so cosmopolitan and I think it's amazing for shopping. One bad thing though about London is the cost of everything, so <span class=\"audionotes\">in terms of</span> cost, I prefer Leeds because that is also very good for shopping, but it's cheaper and also I like Leeds because I have family and friends there so I have many good memories of my time in Leeds.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Tres, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Tres-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>I don't think I've been to enough American cities really to answer that question.

I went this year for, or last year for New Year's and had a wonderful time, but it is dirty, so I don't know.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, Ireland</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-IRE.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>The best city in my country is probably Dublin, the capitol. There's lots of shopping, lots of places to go and eat, and also there's lots of parks inside the city where you can go and relax with your friends, maybe have lunch or a picnic.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Al, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Al-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>The city in my country is probably Newcastle. I'm not going to say London because London's too big, it's too expensive and people are too <span class=\"audionotes\">rude</span>, but Newcastle is a good size. People are friendly. There's lots of things to do. They have a big football stadium and the <span class=\"audionotes\">nightlife</span> is great, so it's Newcastle.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Martin, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Martin-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>The best city in my country, I'd have to say, is Seattle. Why? Because Seattle's pretty much got everthing. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's got <span class=\"audionotes\">lovely</span> mountains everywhere, great ocean views, and a lot of salmon. I like to fish and I like to eat salmon a lot. It's a great place. It's really clean and it's very happy. It's a nice city.</p>\n                            </div>",

I live in a small little island on the east coast of Canada and there's not much there. There's not much entertainment. There's no restaurants. There's no movie theaters, so it's very quiet. Some people would say very boring, but I think you have to find other things to do like hiking or you learn how to play the guitar and play music and reading and writing so I think the bad thing about my hometown is there's not much to do, but it makes you create other things and do other things.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Mark, The Unites States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Mark-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"49\" height=\"70\"></strong>Something bad about my hometown? I guess for me something bad would be it's not very diverse. There's lots of white people and lots of black people, but that's about it. There aren't a lot of Asian people or Europeans or people of different ethnicities and I'm someone who likes New York or a more international type place, so I wish it were a little more <span class=\"audionotes\">diverse</span>.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simon, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simon-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"71\"></strong>Vancouver? What's not good about Vancouver? Well, I think that the people of Vancouver <span class=\"audionotes\">overrate</span> the city, and that's kind of, they think it's the best place to live on earth. It's the nicest looking city on earth. Yes, it's beautiful. It's a really nice place to live but it also rains eight months of the year and it's probably not the most <span class=\"audionotes\">cosmopolitan</span> city on earth.</p>\n                            </div>",

It's too difficult but two or three of my favorites would be Japan and India and I like these two countries because they are very extreme. They are very foreign from my home country, Canada, and there's a lot of things that are different that I don't understand, that are very exotic and rare so I think India and Japan are my two favorite countries in the world.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Al, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Al-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>My favorite country is -- that I've visited -- is probably Spain because I'm not <span class=\"audionotes\">keen on</span> Europe for vacation usually but I've been to Barcelona and Barcelona had everything that you could possibly want from a holiday destination, so Spain I think.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ruth, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Ruth-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>My favorite country I've been to? That's a difficult question.

I saw the pyramids. I saw Mt.

I <span class=\"audionotes\">can't wear</span> red myself because I have ginger hair and a very red face so I look like a tomato, but it's my favorite color otherwise. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Simone, Sweden</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simone-SWE.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What's my favorite color?

Let's see. I've always been afraid of snakes. That's probably because my grandmother and father are also afraid of snakes and I must have been influenced by them somehow and their reaction to seeing snakes. Plus, they're just such – in my opinion – ugly creatures and <span class=\"audionotes\">slimy</span> and just for me not an attractive animal. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Peter, Sweden </strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Peter-SWE.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What am I afraid of?

Well, recently I visited a friend of mine in Shanghai and she made a comment that I thought was very interesting. She said I look like I have money. I don't but compared to the people, regular people walking around on the street, I look like I have a lot of money, and so I suppose that made me think that, gee, I'm really afraid of someone thinking that I have a lot of money and trying to rob me, especially if they have a gun. I have a little bit of <span class=\"audionotes\">paranoia</span> about guns. But, yeah, especially maybe in a big city where I don't know people and maybe I'm in a neighborhood I'm not familiar with or I don't know well.

At home I normally cook boil-in-the-bag curry and microwave rice because it's very, very easy and very quick and I'm a very lazy person so <span class=\"audionotes\">it appeals to me</span> but in England, my home in England, I used to cook - in the oven for my parents - sometimes but just frozen fish and maybe very simple rice or pasta but I cooked it OK but 'well' is maybe not the right word. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Lisa, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Lisa-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What is something I can cook really well?

I can <span class=\"audionotes\">relate to</span> dogs because I share similar characteristics such as being friendly, lovable, loyal and cute. Dogs also can do so many things to help make a person feel good. They're such giving animals and we have a German Sheperd at my parent's home in California and I really miss him now.

My favorite animal is a cat. If you asked me this question last year or two years ago I would say a dog, cause dogs are loyal and friendly and cute but two years ago I acquired a car and since then I have <span class=\"audionotes\">grown to</span> find cats more intelligent than dogs, not so friendly but when they cuddle on you you love them more. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Phil, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Phil-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What's my favorite animal? My favorite animal is definitely a penguin because I think they have very much <span class=\"audionotes\">in common with</span> humans the way they interact with each other and the way their life is very similar to human human relationships. They have one single partner for all their lifetime and they have one baby which they grow up with. They nurture and help to grow up. It's very, very similar to humans. OK, I also like monkeys because they're funny and very cute, but my favorite animal is definitely a penguin. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Adrienne, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Adrienne-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What is my favorite animal? Well, my favorite animal to live with is a cat, so for a pet I would say a cat because they take good care of themselves and they're easy to look after. You can leave them alone for long periods of time. That <span class=\"audionotes\">suits me</span> very well, but I recently saw a movie called The March of the Penguins and I suddenly have a very big appreciation for penguins and how strong they are and how cute they are, really, so I think maybe penguins and cats. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Skip, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Skip-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What is my favorite animal?

I don't want to say live like but that I think about most is the wolf because I grew up in Minnesota and Minnesota in the U.S. has the only native wolf population in the U.S. and so that's usually kind of an image that I try and... you know, strong and independent, but works well in a group. </p>\n                            ",

Money of course because I like shopping a lot and use my credit card more than I should probably and getting fat because any women in their thirties, that's what they're <span class=\"audionotes\">obsessed</span> about especially if they are single.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Phil, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Phil-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What do I worry about? I think my biggest worry at the moment is a career. I'm 26 now and I've spend a lot of the last fews years traveling around since I left university and most of my friends have <span class=\"audionotes\">settled down</span> and have a good job and a good career behind them, so sometimes I do worry that when I go back I will be too old for companies to want me, so I'm slightly worried about having a future career.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Barbara, Australia</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Barbaraa-AU.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>So, what do I worry about? I guess I worry about the usual things, for example, having money in the bank and being healthy. I guess being healthy is what's most important to me so I <span class=\"audionotes\">take care of</span> to exercise and I watch what I eat because I need this body to last me at least another fifty years.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Conrad, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Conrad-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What do I worry about? That's a tough question. I don't worry that much but sometimes I do think about after my retirement and where am I going to be living, what are my kids going to be doing. Can I still <span class=\"audionotes\">support</span> them? Can I send them to college? but that's a very minor worry and I don't think I worry about much. </p>\n                            ",

Definitely, adventure. I hate sitting on the beach or sitting by the side of the pool, so I like to get out there and do things and the crazier the better, so for example when I was in New Zealand not so long ago I went white water rafting. That was a fantastic experience.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Lisa, Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Lisa-CAN.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>On vacation do I prefer to adventure or relaxation? I would have to say that lately as I have been working a lot I prefer to have relaxation. I prefer to go somewhere where I wouldn't have to do anything or someone would bring me my meals and all I had to do was choose from what I was going to eat or a menu of what I was going to do or what I was going to drink without having to do anything for myself.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Phil, England</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Phil-UK.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>On vacation, do I prefer to have adventure or relaxation. That's a very difficult question because I enjoy both on vacation however I think because my life is very relaxing at home and my work is very easy, I'd like to have some kind of adventure on holidays. In the summer holiday, I went to a mountain about three hours where I lived, and I hiked to the top of the mountain on a very, very hot day. It was very, very warm and I didn't take enough drinks, or I prepared very badly so it was a really difficult climb. However, I had a fantastic time and I would do it again tomorrow if I could.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simone, Sweden</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simone-SWE.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>On vacation do I prefer to have adventure or relaxation? I like both. I think you need a mixture to really relax. You need to <span class=\"audionotes\">escape from your everyday life</span>. You need both. I guess, both relaxation and adventure. Do new <span class=\"audionotes\">stuff</span> and relax in the evening.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Skip, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Skip-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>On vacation do I prefer to have adventure or relaxation? Oh, <span class=\"audionotes\">that's a hard one</span>. I suppose it depends on where I am. I do like adventure, but I don't like to have an adventure in a strange place because it's easy for things to get out of control so I suppose usually if I take a vacation, vacation it's to relax, but I do love adventure.</p>\n                            ",

This is a difficult question for someone to answer I think, but I'll <span class=\"audionotes\">give it a shot</span>. I think my best qualities are probably that I have a good sense of humor. I genuinely like people and I like talking to people and I like to be entertaining if i can possibly be.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Conrad, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Conrad-US.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What is my best quality? I'd say my best quality is my friendliness. I always try to be positive and polite and friendly to people who I meet, especially the first time and I try to continue that but regardless of who they are I try to give them, you know, treat them friendly. I enjoy being friendly, so it's not really work to me.

My best qualities are the fact that I am a good friend. I'm considerate and caring. I'm a good listener. I can always... I'm always there to hear if my friends having a bad day or just really needs to talk, and I think I'm just really nice, even though I'm not always nice to everyone.

I think my best quality has to be the ability to laugh at myself. English humor is very much based around <span class=\"audionotes\">laughing at yourself</span> and also laughing with others at themselves so my best quality definitely is that I can laugh at myself and with others when they laugh at me.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Simone, Sweden</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Simone-SWE.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>What's my best quality? I think it's that I'm very <span class=\"audionotes\">open minded</span> so I always... I'm not afraid of new things, and nothing shocks me so I learn new things a lot that most people don't because they are too narrow minded, I think. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Chip, The United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/50MX-Lindsay.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>OK, what are my best qualities? I guess the one that I think is the most important for me is to be curious. I want to find out new things, I want to go places. I want to have new experiences. I don't like to just sit around where I know everything because it stops being interesting and inspiring after awhile. I like to have new things happen to me and meet new people and that is what keeps me creative and I have <span class=\"audionotes\">fresh ideas</span> that way.</p>\n                            ",

Well, let's just <span class=\"audionotes\">stick with</span> one for now cause the list could be very long if we did all of my worst qualities. I think one of my worst qualities is that often times I can be very stubborn, especially when I think I'm right, even when I'm not, so stubbornness definitely is one of my worst qualities.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Peter, Sweden</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img class=\"floatright\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix1/Peter-SWE.jpg\" alt=\"speaker\" width=\"50\" height=\"70\"></strong>My worst quality would be that I don't have any patience at all.

That's a pretty easy answer. My worst, absolute worst quality is procrastinating. I am a terrible procrastinator. I will wait to pack for a big vacation on the day of the trip, on the day that I leave. I remember is school, I used to wait to finish twenty page papers.

My worst quality has to be my patience.

I had a really, really good time. Besides the fact that I had just <span class=\"audionotes\">become of age</span> so I was able to go to more places because now I was allowed, and I had a really fun time at the birthday party.

I can write all the time and I love reading new books. When I finish one I already have the next one all set. The one thing I didn't like about the English class was that we had to do book reports.

I don't <span class=\"audionotes\">respect them to a higher degree</span> than I would other figures.

I do respect some athletes like Dikembe Mutombo who was a famous basketball player who used his profile and his money to do a lot of good work in his native Africa.\n                              </p><p><strong>Liz, Sweden</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-SW-Liz.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>The famous athlete that I like is Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the football player from Sweden actually.

He knows how to manage his <span class=\"audionotes\">professional life</span> and his private life which I like about him. And he did a lot of advertising, commercials, and he's kind of sexy.

I don't quite know this yet, but let me correct it here.\" Anytime you learn something, it's <span class=\"audionotes\">trial and error</span>.

Well, I think that a good teacher is able to listen well to a student's concerns, answer questions well, explain anything that the student might not understand. I remember my favorite teacher in elementary school, she was always able to listen attentively to the students and <span class=\"audionotes\">in reverse</span> we were able to listen attentively to her when she would explain or teach us something.</p>\n                              <p><strong>Ray / United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-US-Ray.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Good teacher, good teacher, good teacher. Well, one thing that makes a good teacher is somebody who has the ability to <span class=\"audionotes\">place themselves in the mind</span> of the student, the person who is trying to learn whatever the subject is. A lot of people who are <span class=\"audionotes\">experts in a field</span>, they know it very, very, very well, but they've forgotten what it was like to be somebody who doesn't know that field. So they <span class=\"audionotes\">take certain things for granted</span> when they explain and as a result, they leave things out that somebody who doesn't know the field needs to know in order to understand what is being said. </p>\n                              <p><strong>Demelza / Australia</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-AU-Demelza.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think what makes a good teacher is someone that can identify both what they think the students need in their class and also be able to provide a way that students can understand different things for example grammar and make the classroom an enjoyable experience too. \n                              </p><p><strong>Jeff / Canada</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-CA-Jeff.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>What I think makes a good teacher is patience and love for you work. I think you have to love teaching to be a really good teacher. And I think you need patience and you really want to see the students succeed. And that's what makes a good teacher I think. <br>\n                              </p><p><strong>Nydja / United States</strong><br>\n                                <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-US-Nydja.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>A good teacher is a person who challenges their students <span class=\"audionotes\">at every turn</span> and <span class=\"audionotes\">breaks down</span> their <span class=\"audionotes\">accepted norms</span> and teaches them to <span class=\"audionotes\">be open to</span> new ones. \n                              </p><p><strong>Hoa / Vietnam</strong><br>\n                            What makes a good teacher? <span class=\"audionotes\">That's a hard question</span>. Well, I think a <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-VN-Hoa.jpg\" width=\"49\"></strong>good teacher should be knowledgable, first of all. I think he or she should be <span class=\"audionotes\">dedicated to his work</span>. He should be good at convincing, talking -- <span class=\"audionotes\">what I mean is</span> like they should have communication skills to interact with students and to make the students work.

I learnt a lot of Spanish by having a Spanish boyfriend, so I would also recommend a close relationship with someone who speaks the language you want to learn.\n\t\t\t\t\t          </p><p><strong>Michael / Singapore</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX4-Michael.jpg\" width=\"51\"></strong>The best way to learn English is to take whatever you learn in class and to practice it outside of class, because we know that most of the students they just learn it in class, but they don't have <span class=\"audionotes\">opportunities</span> to practice what they learn outside, so if you don't have any English speaking friends, what you can do is of course go online and there's a lot of pen pals and you can just make some friends online to practice your English and that would work as well.\n\t\t\t\t\t          </p><p><strong>Mike / United States</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX5-US-Mike.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Well, nobody learns the same the way, so there are a lot of ways to learn. I think the best way is probably to vary the learning methods. Do a little reading, a little speaking, a little writing, and a little listening. Try to combine the different methods and get a <span class=\"audionotes\">balanced approach</span>.\n\t\t\t\t              </p><p><strong>Hanna / Australia</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t              <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerthumbs/MX4-Hanna.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>The best way to learn English is to make lots of friends who speak English. If you have a lot of friends who speak English, then it becomes a very interactive experience and you also have <span class=\"audionotes\">incentive</span> to learn more.                              \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>",

Obviously, when you meet new people, you always need to give someone a chance. So, I think that a chance is always good for someone, probably better than judging on <span class=\"audionotes\">first impressions</span>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t      </p><p><strong>Paul / England</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/UK-Paul.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>A proverb I like is \"<em><strong>Don't count your chickens before they hatch</strong></em>,\" which is a cautionary proverb. It means don't always <span class=\"audionotes\">bank on</span> you guessing the result. It also a reminder that life can change very quickly, so it's good to learn a certain degree of patience and allow certain things to <span class=\"audionotes\">run their course</span> before you get excited.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t      </p><p><strong>Gareth / England</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/UK-Gareth1.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>There's a very famous proverb from Confucius, and it's \"<strong><em>Hear and I forget; see and I understand; I do and I know.</em></strong>\" I like it because it means until you actually do something, it's hard to really, truly know it. I believe that a lot of the times when you're learning, and you're learning by hearing stuff from your lecture or from a podcast, it's very difficult to acquire that knowledge and to actually really <span class=\"audionotes\">grasp</span> it. When you see something, it gets a little bit better, but when you do something, that's when you really truly know something.\n\t\t\t\t\t          </p><p><strong>Katia / Mexico</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/MX-Ekatarina.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>One proverb that I think of often, it says, \"<em><strong>Everything will be as it should be.</strong></em>\" When I think of it, I get very relaxed, I don't tend to worry as much as I usually do. For me, that means, regardless of how much I worry or how much I try regardless of that, everything will be as it should be. So, that's a proverb that I really like.\n\t\t\t\t\t          </p><p><strong>Lindsay / United States</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/US-Lyndsay.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I really like the proverb, \"<strong><em>The grass is always greener on the other side.</em></strong>\" I think that's really true, and I find that it's always like that. I always want what I can't have, and then when I get that, then I find out that it's not as great as I had hoped it would be. So, because of this, I try to always <span class=\"audionotes\">keep that in mind</span> and be happy for what I have.\n\t\t\t\t              </p><p><strong>Warren / Canada </strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t              <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/CA-Warren.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I think \"<strong><em>What goes around, comes around</em></strong>\" is what comes to mind for me. I think it is really true. Basically, if you do something good, good things will happen to you. And if you do bad things, bad things are going to happen to you, maybe not right away but eventually.                              \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>",

Like I said before about team sports, I am an <span class=\"audionotes\">individualist</span>. I like working in teams theoretically, but a lot of times, it doesn't work. My problem is that a lot of the time, I don't study for tests until the night before, so it's difficult to get groups together and study for the test. And I find that although maybe you learn better when you're studying in groups, it takes a lot longer and you get a lot less done in the same period of time. So, when I'm by myself, I'm able to just <span class=\"audionotes\">power through</span> the material and study hard and get it done.\n\t\t\t                  </p><p><strong>Phoebe / China</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                  <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/CN-Phoebe.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Do you like to study alone or in a group? My answer will be in a group. Definitely. Because when you study alone, you need to have high self-motivation. I'm kind of lack of that, so I need a group.\n\t\t\t                  </p><p><strong>Gareth / England </strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                    <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/UK-Gareth1.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>I prefer studying alone, but I like to <span class=\"audionotes\">collaborate</span> with other people and to discuss ideas. I think collaboration can help you to develop your own ideas and see things from a different point of view.                              \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>",

There's a regular bus service that runs between my house and my school, which is about five kilometers or so. But when I'm at home with my family in New Mexico, I don't use public transportation at all. I think that American public transportation is <span class=\"audionotes\">few and far between</span>. it's not very well-funded, and it's not very good, unless you live in the city. Everybody has cars, so you don't really have a need for public transportation, because everybody is able to drive himself where they need to go.\n\t\t\t\t\t          </p><p><strong>Sarah / England </strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <strong><img alt=\"speaker\" class=\"floatright\" height=\"70\" src=\"../../Assets/graphics/mixerpix6/UK-Sarah.jpg\" width=\"50\"></strong>Public transport is something that I don't often use at all.

I'm an African-American, and living outside of an African-American community and having to get a haircut can be <span class=\"audionotes\">a trying experience</span>. I lived overseas in an Asian community and I had my haircut. The first time I had my haircut, I didn't cry, but the person cutting my hair cried, because she didn't understand how to cut my hair.

He did give me a smart business cut; however, it seems that the barber may have learned his <span class=\"audionotes\">trade</span> in the 1920s, and it was very severe, short back and sides.
